# python-fetcher
A simple fetch program written in Python

Special thanks to: 
                    NeuralNine for the tutorial, and code. 
                    Felix Lee for the ASCII cat.

This is not finished! I still need to fix the fact it doesn't recognise/print my CPU.
I also would like to change the formatting and color scheme too.
